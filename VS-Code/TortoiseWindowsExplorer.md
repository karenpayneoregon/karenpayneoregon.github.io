Setup a repository from SVN, using mobile claims as an example.

- Select a folder e.g. C:\OED\WebProjects
- Right click 
- Select Tortoise [see figure 1](#Figure-1)
- Select Repo-Browser
- Enter address for mobile claims [see figure 2](#Figure-2)
- Sign-in with Windows credentials
- Right click
- Select Checkout
- Ensure URL address is correct
- Ensure Checkout directory is set [see figure 3](#Figure-3)
- Click OK
- Project is then checkout

In VS Code
- File menu
- Open folder
- Traverse to C:\OED\WebProjects
- Single click mobile_claims

At this point SVN is setup and ready to use although unless Tortoise extension is setup/configured correctly, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> will not copy a file to the development server.
