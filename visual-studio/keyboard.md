# Keyboard shortcuts


Visual Studio has several schema mappings were each have their own shortcut combinations along with some Visual Studio extensions e.g. ReSharper as shown in **figure 1**.


## Changing one or more shortcuts

Each developer on a team may have different keyboard mappings which means one developer may want to select a word using the keyboard which uses <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> while another developer with a different keymapping and wants to use the same key combination.

To do this, select from Visual Studio menu `Tools`, `Options` followed by typing `keyboard` into the search input as shown in **figure 2**.

Next start typing SelectCurrentWord as shown in **figure 3**.

## Sharing or backing up keyboard shortcuts

* Select `Tool` menu
* Select `Import and Export Settings...`
* Find `keyboard` as shown in **figure 4**.
* Follow steps to complete.
