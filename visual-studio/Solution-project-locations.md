# Solution/project locations


The default location for solution and projects defaults to under my documents. Although this is fine an alternate is to use a folder location that keeps all solutions under a higher level folder along with a folder for each version of Visual Studio.

For example, working with Visual Studio 2017, C:\Dotnetland\VS2017 and C:\Dotnetland\VS2019 for Visual Studio 2019.

## Reasons

:heavy_check_mark: Versioning (can also work in tangent with Git branching)

:heavy_check_mark: WOrking in a team all members use the same location

:heavy_check_mark: Your organization has polices to where executables can be created

# Set the location for projects

- From Visual Studio menu select `Tools`, `Options`
- Type `Locations` into the search input.
- Select `Locations` node
- Change the location

Once the location has been changed any time a new project is created the folder entered in the last bullet will be used as the default location.
